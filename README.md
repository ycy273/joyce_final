## Losing Weight!!
**The character is preparing for the vocation to Cancun and she's worried about wearing a bikini to beach. Her dad said that if she's over 60kg, he'll  not support her the money, and she'll lose the chance to go to Cancun. We have to help her lose weight before the vocation starts! (Her ideal weight is 50kg)**

Now she is 60kg (The thing is that I'm worried about going to Cancun with a bikini, but 60 is not my actual weight lol), and she could not be over 60, or she'll lose the chance. Thus, she has to give up being lazy. Go to work out first!!

She works out and swims as exercise. Every time she works out, she'll lose 0.8kg, and if she goes swimming, she'll lose 0.5kg.
However, sometimes she can't help herself eat junk foods such as cheesecakes and bbq chickens; and thus, she'll gain weight. (1.5kg for cheesecakes and 2kg for bbq chickens).
And if she's too lazy for the workout and chooses to sleep, she'll gain 1kg. (Life is tough)
